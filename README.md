 Text-classification-with-Bert-Transformer:
 In this code the dataset from kaggle was used.(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) #The dataset is contain a number of description about different courses and our classes are 4 courses #So we used preprocessing method we get rid off unnecessary data #and then our data frame would be based on two parameters description of courses with necessary words and courses #So the model was trained with Bert transformer algorithm pytorch , And find the accuracy in prediction
